    <h1>CRIMR Description</h1>
    <i>A product of CRIMR Studios: Eric Walker, Graham Earley, and Charlie Imhoff</i>

      <p>
        CRIMR is a webapp that allows you to browse recent crime activity in the
        San Francisco area. You can do a broad search of crime (through districts, descriptions,
        categories, resolution status of the crime, and even the day of week), or you can
        focus your search in by specifying a certain district, category, day of week, and
        or resolution status, and then searching from there.
      </p>
      <h3>Feature List</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Broad search of crimes (looking through the various attributes)</li>
          <li>Narrowed down search of crimes (looking through crimes with certain attributes
            set. For example, searching through all unresolved crimes on Wednesdays)</li>
          <li>The CrimeScore Index: rank your fear of all the crime categories and receive
          a personalized 'CrimeScore' letting you know how scared you should be of the
          current crime level.</li>
          <li>Get a random crime (and see it on a map). Practice vigilante justice at your own
          discretion.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h1>Changes Since Conception</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>A main change from our initial conception (seen especially in our mockups) is
        the visual design. Our HTML forms are not as nicely formatted (we didn't have much
        time to play with prettier JQuery forms), for one thing. Also, with the relatively short timeframe
        of the project, we didn't focus too much on CSS, although that would have helped our site
        be more true to the mockups.</li>
        <li>Some of our features were lumped into the search. For example, <i>'Find out which days
          of the week are most dangerous'</i> is now simply up to the user to figure out by using our
          search (search for Wednesday and see how much crime there is) rather than there being
          a set page that shows you what the crime activity is like for each day.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CrimeScore methodology</h2>
    <p> Here's how the CrimeScore is calculated:
        Multiply the amount of crimes in each category by the user's
        rating for that category (0-10). Add all these up. Now, in order to make this decimal
        between 0 and 1 (for understandability) divide
        by the highest possible value for the numerator (which is the case
        where the user rates all categories at 10). Thus, the denominator is
        the quantity of each crime, multiplied by ten. The numerator is the quantity of each crime,
        multiplied by their respective ratings (0-10). This lets the quotient give a result between
        0 and 1. Now multiply this decimal by 100 and round for the final result.
    </p>
