    <h1>CRIMR Description</h1>

      <p>
        CRIMR is a webapp that allows you to browse recent crime activity in the
        San Francisco area. You can do a broad search of crime (through districts, descriptions,
        categories, resolution status of the crime, and even the day of week), or you can
        focus your search in by specifying a certain district, category, day of week, and
        or resolution status, and then searching from there.
      </p>
      <p> <b>Feature List</b>

          <li>Narrowed down search of crimes (looking through crimes with certain attributes

          <li>The CrimeScore Index: rank your fear of all the crime categories and receive
          a personalized 'CrimeScore' letting you know how scared you should be of the

    <h2>CrimeScore methodology</h2>
    <p> Here's how the CrimeScore is calculated:
        Multiply the amount of crimes in each category by the user's
        rating for that category (0-10). Add all these up. Now, divide
        by the highest possible value for the numerator (which is the case
        where the user rates all categories at 10). So, the denominator is
        the quantity of each crime, multiplied by ten. This lets the quotient give a result between
        0 and 1. Now multiply this decimal by 100 and round.
