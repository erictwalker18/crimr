    <h2>CrimeScore methodology</h2>
    <p> Here's how the CrimeScore is calculated:
        Multiply the amount of crimes in each category by the user's
        rating for that category (0-10). Add all these up. Now, divide
        by the highest possible value for the numerator (which is the case
        where the user rates all categories at 10). Now multiply this number
        by 100.
